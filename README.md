# EyeHand-Virtual-Mouse
This project is designed to help users who cannot speak, hear, or use traditional input devices. The system detects hand gestures for mouse control and tracks eye movements to allow users to draw or write on screen. It uses real-time computer vision technology to provide an easy and touch-free way to interact with computers.
